# FMCG

Introduction : 
A Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company entered into the instant noodles business two
years back. Their higher management has noticed that there is a mismatch in the demand and
supply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and vice-versa which results in a loss in
inventory cost and ultimately loss to the company. Hence, the higher management wants to
optimize the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in the entire country.
 
Goal : 
The objective is to build a model, using historical data that will determine an
optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time from the respective warehouse.

1. To perform EDA, data processing, model, evaluation and charts. 
2. To learn various insights on data.
3. To build models and choose the most accurate one to evaluate.
